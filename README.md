This project arose from my personal need for an effective application to monitor my financial resources, especially while staying in a foreign country. 
Inspired by my own challenge, I decided to create my own solution, perfectly tailored to my individual needs. I knew that not all existing applications had the key features essential to me, 
so I made the decision to develop this application with the aim of meeting my specific expectations.
